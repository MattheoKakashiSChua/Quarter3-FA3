        <h1>The Trio of Torture in Mentality</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, a kid named Roll, was excited to go to school because it recently added 3 subjects: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology</p>
        <p>"I am very excited to learn and explore about these 3 subjects!" Roll said. Suddenly, he was stopped midway by what seems to be a student wearing graduation outfit.</p> 
        <p>"Hello?" Rick asked. The student introduced himself with deep voice "Hey, I heard your excited about these new subjects?". "You heard me right. Yes." Roll responded.</p> 
        <p>"The name is Rick and I'd just wanna say that you will regret what you said earlier" The student spoke with serious face. Roll calmly asked "Why is that?"</p> 
        <p>"Follow me back to my house. I will explain to your teacher why you will be late." Rick said. Roll was thinking about what Rick said then he said "How can I trust you? I don't even know what your gonna do? I am sorry but I cannot follow you" and went on forward to school.</p>
        <p>"Remember this conversation, kid! You will regret this." Rick stated with signs of anger.</p>
        <p>At school, it was very normal discussing the 3 subjects. Unexpectedly, the teacher prepared a test to see if the students learned something. Roll's heart was pounding showing signs of fear because according he said "I guess that guy was right. The 3 subjects are so boring that I even fell asleep in one of the classes."</p>
        <p>After the students were dismissed, Roll tried to find Rick whilst crying. After a few minutes, Roll found Rick on the same spot of their conversation.</p>
        <p>Rick confidently stated "So, how was it?". Roll said "YOU WERE RIGHT! I HATE THE 3 SUBJECTS" while crying and pleaded to take him to Rick's Laboratory.</p>
        <p>Rick accepted Roll's request but said "We must go silently. We cannot get caught no matter what." then Roll followed him and his instructions.</p>
        <p>They made it to Rick's home and into his secret passage leading to his lab. In the lab, it has very advanced technology according to Roll.</p> 
        <p>Rick explained that he had secretly been collecting data from past students that had a hard time in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology regarding about their grades.</p>
        <p>Rick handed Roll a piece of paper and said "This was all the data I could collect. These are from 1st to 4th Quarter."</p>
        <h4>The data Rick was able to collect: </h4>
        <div class="physics">
            <h4>Physics Passers from the 1st to 4th Quarter: </h4> 
            <p id="first"></p>
        </div> 

        <div class="chemistry">
            <h4>Chemistry Passers from the 1st to 4th Quarter: </h4> 
            <p id="second"></p>
        </div> 

        <div class="biology">
            <h4>Biology Passers from the 1st to 4th Quarter: </h4> 
            <p id="third"></p>
        </div> 

        
        <p>Roll was confused and shocked. Before he could say anything, Rick said "I know, its strange, isnt it? A constant number throughout a whole school year.</p> 
        <p id="compare"></p> 
        <p>"I have also been collecting about who could possibly got the high scores in atleast one or two of the subjects." Rick said then Roll simply asked "How was it?"</p> 
        <p>"I used the number of passers in physics and tried to convert it into a letter using the whole alphabet, complex codes and formulas" Rick said.</p> 
        <p id="letter"></p> 
        <p>Roll was confused about the data and asked "What does this mean?" Rick responded "I don't know. Let me find more information about this student."</p> 
        <p id="complete"></p> 
        <p>"Okay, Thank you for this! I have to go now ." Roll left immediately and decided to spread the data regarding the number of passers to his friend groups.</p>
        <p>One day, all the students gathered outside the school striking that the system should get rid of the 3 new subjects.</p> 
        <p>The Principal said "Can't you understand? We're trying to help you become smarter in life. Is it that hard for you?" Roll was brave and told the principal that its too hard for all of us especially for the students from the past.</p>
        <p>The Principal responded with "What can support your statement?" Roll said "This!" then handed the paper which was the data Rick was able to collect through his research.</p>
        <p>The Principal himself is also shocked of the data and decided to discuss this with the teachers in his meeting office. The striking students are waiting with hope and confidence.</p> 
        <p>After a brief discussion, the Principal made an announcement that the subjects Physics, Chemistry, and Biology are removed from the school's curriculum.</p>
        <p>The students were very hyped after hearing this. They were jumping around and hugging each other.</p>
        <p>All of the students thanked Roll for standing up with evidence but in the end (Roll's heart), it was all because of Rick and his research.</p>
